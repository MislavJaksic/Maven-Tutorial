## [Introduction](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html)

Maven objectives:
* easy build process
* uniform build system: uses a project object model (POM)
* quality project information: log, cross reference, mailing list, dependency, unit test report
* best practices: separate source and tests, standardized test
* transparent migration to new features

Maven is not:
* a site and documentation tool
* an extension of Ant to let you download dependencies
* a set of reusable Ant scriptlets
